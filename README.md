Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

📌 Abstract

Email spam is a common issue in online communication. It fills inboxes with unwanted messages and may contain harmful content. This project builds an Email Spam Detection System that automatically identifies spam emails using machine learning techniques.
The system processes email text, extracts important words, and trains a model to recognize spam patterns. When a new email is given, the model predicts whether it is spam or not. This project helps improve email security and saves user time.

🚀 Features

Detects spam and non-spam (ham) emails
Uses machine learning for accurate prediction
Simple and easy-to-use system
Fast processing of email text
Improves email safety and productivity

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NLTK / re (for text processing)
Machine Learning Models:
Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression
Development Tool:
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

📊 Output

The system takes an email message as input
It analyzes the text content
The output will be:
